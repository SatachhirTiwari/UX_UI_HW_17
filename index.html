                    <text> In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, staple grocery items quickly went out of stock, causing shoppers to blindly visit multiple stores 
                        in search of all their items for the best price. Shoppers can benefit from an itemized view of the products they need to compare the total 
                        cost of their list at different stores before deciding where they will shop.
